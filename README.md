# BigMap: Location Sharing for Groups
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2016. It implemented Android, websockets, and the LAMP stack to provide groups of users a way to share their location in real time using their phone and the Google Maps API. As of this writing, the server used to host the service is down, but the code here is functional if it were ever reimplemented on another server.

The application allows users to create groups for people to share their location. Those with Android phones could download the app off the website and begin broadcasting to individual channels with the press of a button. When broadcasting, the broadcasters would show up on other users phones like so:

The group map was available in both the Android application and on desktop browsers. Feel free to message me if you have any questions on how it works.
