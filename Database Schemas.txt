Static & dynamic information pertains to memory allocation. It does not mean that the values are fixed.

METADATA
--------
Tables:
	Static_variables (MemberCount INTEGER, ChannelCount INTEGER)
	* MemberCount exists so that we know the bounds of the member id's. 
	  For example, if there are 50 members, we cannot have a member id
	  of 62.

MEMBER
------
Tables:
	User_Info (id PRIMARY KEY, Username varchar(20), Password varchar(20)) // static variables
	Channels_Hosting (host MEMBER.user_info.id, hosting CHANNEL.channel_info.id)
	Channels_Broadcasting (host MEMBER.user_info.id, broadcasting CHANNEL.channel_info.id)

CHANNEL
-------
Tables:
	Channel_Info (id PRIMARY KEY, DateCreated DATETIME, Host MEMBER.user_info.id) // static variables
	Broadcast_Member (Broadcaster MEMBER.user_info.id, Channel Channel_Info.id, CurrentLat FLOAT, CurrentLong FLOAT) 
	Location_History (Broadcaster MEMBER.user_info.id, time DATETIME, Latitude FLOAT, Longitude FLOAT) 

	*inherits data from broadcastmember
	*broadcast_member would also hold status posts and other relevant information in later versions
	*location history does not need a channel id, because the channel id does not impact the broadcaster's location
