To do:
-make signin case insensitive for the username input
-put php files into their own seperate folder (make html docs link to folder)(X)
-title PHP files so that they have matching title format(X)
-find a more secure way to store user info and password on Android (instead of using MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE)
-make sure that checking you broadcasting channels doesn't reconstruct the locationService (X)
-learn about mod_rewrite to hide php files from public knowledge (Apparently I don't need to do this)(X)
-Clear out all the TODO's in the Android code
-Change pages with signin/user-verification to handle requests via Ajax
-learn better AJAX security methods and apply them to the JS code
-Give browser user's the option to resize their map whenever a new user broadcasts the channel
	*make this non-invasive, not like a browser alert
-In the PHP files, look for loops which make mySQL queries within in them. MySQL queries ought to be made after the loop, such that there is only 1 query as opposed to 1000 queries (that threatens system performance)
	*Instances of this happening:
		-addLocationPacket in ReceiveLocationPacket
-viewchannelcontent is currently displaying the map, even if the user is not a member
		

Recurring TODO
-always run js code through compression before putting it online
